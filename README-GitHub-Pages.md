# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Setup Instructions

Your ZenPrivata website is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Repository Setup
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push this project to your GitHub repository

### 2. GitHub Pages Configuration
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/docs" folder
6. Click "Save"

### 3. Important Notes

#### Static Site Limitations
Since GitHub Pages only serves static files, the following features have been adapted:

- **Contact Forms**: The current contact form uses backend APIs that won't work on GitHub Pages. You'll need to:
  - Use a service like Netlify Forms, Formspree, or EmailJS
  - Or integrate with GitHub Issues API for contact submissions

#### Files Structure
- **Production files**: Located in `/docs` folder (built from `/client` source)
- **Source files**: Located in `/client` folder (development files)
- **Build command**: `npm run build` creates the production files

#### Automated Deployment (Optional)
The included GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) can automatically build and deploy your site when you push to the main branch. To use this:

1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Change source to "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will handle building and deployment automatically

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional)
To use a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `/docs` folder with your domain name
2. Configure your domain's DNS to point to GitHub Pages

### 5. Local Development
To continue developing locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be updated in the `/docs` folder, ready for GitHub Pages.

## Contact Form Solutions

Since the current backend won't work on GitHub Pages, here are alternatives:

1. **Formspree**: Add `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"` to forms
2. **Netlify Forms**: Deploy to Netlify instead of GitHub Pages
3. **EmailJS**: Client-side email service
4. **GitHub Issues**: Use GitHub API to create issues from contact forms
